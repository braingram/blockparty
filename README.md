The boards are ordered 0 to N-1 from left to right from the board plugged into the computer. So board 0 will be the one with the usb connected, board 1 will be the tube to the right and so on. The cages are also numbered starting at 0 where 0 is the cage to the left of board 0. For a chain of 2 tubes and 3 cages the numbers will look like this:

```
Cages:  0   1    2
Tubes:     0   1
```

For a ring the numbering is the same. Below shows the point where the ring is joined.

```
Cages:  ...  7   8   9   0  1  ...
Tubes:   ...   7   8   9   0  1 ...
```

So for a ring of 10 tubes and 10 cages the tubes and cages will be numbered 0 to 9.
